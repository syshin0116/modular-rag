The\\nreduced physical volumes of bitumen has helped to balance\\nthe overall supply availability for October.Domestic prices in South Korea were raised by $51/t for\\nOctober, as recent firmness in crude values lent to higher\\ndomestic selling prices. Demand outlook for October remains\\nslightly mixed, with local players wary of the recent spike\\nin Covid-19 cases following the Thanksgiving festival holiday\\nrecently.In Japan, domestic prices were raised by ¥1,000/t to\\n¥63,513-71,619/t ex-tank.

The upward revi-\\nsions were seen as mostly in line with the firmness in global\\ncrude prices, with domestic demand expected to improve\\npost-Golden Week. Another smaller state-owned refiner\\nalso raised listed prices by 230 yuan/t at its terminal in the\\nsouthwest.Ongoing power shortages in parts of China had limited\\nimpact on production. Some refineries in areas affected by\\npower shortages may have slowed the rate of production,\\nbut supply levels were mostly unaffected.A state-owned refinery in Shandong also resumed opera-\\ntions on 25 September after a planned turnaround. Two\\nrefineries in the east and in the south are due to undergo a\\nmonth-long maintenance from October. Overall supply levels\\nare expected to remain ample with the refiner planning to\\nraise overall bitumen production by about 50,000-100,000t\\nin October.

       " 18: \"Argus BitumenIssue 21-39 | Friday 1 October 2021NewsNarrow margins pressure Iran's bitumenIranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc during\\nMarch-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costs\\nof production and weak demand from key markets.Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from\\n2.962mn t to 2.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August\\n2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result,\\nbitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during\\nthe same period.Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in\\ndomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also\\nseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of\\nVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel\\noil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of\\nfuel oil and has reduced export volumes.“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is\\nno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said\\nseveral local traders.“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past\\nmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our\\ndebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said\\nseveral producers.As a result, the number of companies trading or selling\\nbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.A gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers\\nbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy-\\ners from key markets. This was further underpinned by the\\nimpact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government\\nfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and\\nproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT\\ncosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry\\nparticipants.

This was sup-\\nported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase\\nfuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to\\nweak demand from bitumen producers.On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid\\nby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower\\nyear-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets.

As a result,\\nbitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during\\nthe same period.Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in\\ndomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also\\nseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of\\nVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel\\noil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of\\nfuel oil and has reduced export volumes.“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is\\nno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said\\nseveral local traders.“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past\\nmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our\\ndebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said\\nseveral producers.As a result, the number of companies trading or selling\\nbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.A gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers\\nbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy-\\ners from key markets. This was further underpinned by the\\nimpact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government\\nfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and\\nproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT\\ncosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry\\nparticipants. The government did not give a tax rebate toSingapore and Rayong waterborneSingapore pen 60/70 waterborne\\nThailand pen 60/70 waterborne$/tmany exporters in the past two years and imposed a bitu-\\nmen export tax from March 2021 onwards.VB feed supply fell by 21pc from 3.24mn t to 2.56mn t\\nbetween 22 March and 22 August this year. This was sup-\\nported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase\\nfuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to\\nweak demand from bitumen producers.On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid\\nby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower\\nyear-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exports\\nfell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t sold\\nin July. Meanwhile Iran’s export sales stood at 431,000t in\\nAugust 2020, according to data from the Iran Mercantile\\nExchange.Vietnam’s bitumen demand to riseBitumen demand from Vietnam looks set to increase in the\\nnext few years, supported by an ambitious road develop-\\nment plan that seeks to construct over 5,000km of express-\\nways between 2021-2030.The Road Network Development Plan which was unveiled\\nthis month seeks to develop over 5,000km of expressways in\\nthe country by 2030, up from 3,841km in 2021.Key areas for expressway development include exten-\\nsions to the ongoing North-South Expressway project, as well\\nas the 14 expressways in the north, which alone would total\\nabout 2,305km. It also includes 10 expressways making up\\naround 1,431km in the central and central highlands region,\\nand another 10 expressways totalling around 1,290km in the\\nsouth.On top of the new additions to the expressways, there\\nare also plans for 172 national highway routes totallingArgus successfully completes annual Iosco\\nassurance reviewArgus has completed the ninth external assurance\\nreview of its price benchmarks covering crude oil,\\nproducts, LPG, petrochemicals, biofuels, thermal coal,\\ncoking coal, iron ore, steel, natural gas and biomass\\nbenchmarks.

The investment capital for the plan is estimated to be\\nabout 900,000bn dong ($39.6bn), according to a draft issued\\nby Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport.

The country imported close to 890,000t\\nof bitumen in 2020, the highest in the last five years. New\\nroad construction projects are expected to continue as the\\ngovernment pushes for infrastructure development in tan-\\ndem with economic goals, and has positioned Vietnam as an\\nattractive business hub.The road development plan is also aligned with Vietnam’s\\n11th Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP), which covers\\nthe period of 2021-2025 and includes the goal of achieving\\nan average Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 6.5-7pc in the\\nnext five years.Ghana's new bitumen terminal delayedGhanaian state-owned oil and gas marketing firm Goil has\\npushed back the completion date for a new $35mn bitumen\\nterminal and conversion project at the port of Tema to the\\nend of this year.The 6,000t terminal — which will supply imported AC-10\\nand AC-20 bitumen performance grades to newly built poly-\\nmer-modified bitumen (PMB) and bitumen emulsions plants\\n— had been slated for completion by the end of this month.\\nCovid-related issues are understood to be partly responsible\\nfor the delay.Goil's joint venture partner in the project is Ivory Coast\\nbitumen producer and exporter SMB, which has 300,000 t/yr\\nof bitumen production capacity at its Abidjan refinery. The\\nproject was announced in 2017 and construction work began\\ntwo years later. It is now 94pc complete.Once operations start, bitumen imports into Tema will be\\nfed to the terminal by a 3km pipeline, which will be electri-\\ncally heated to keep the road paving product liquid before it\\nis discharged into Goil's newly built storage tanks.The imported bitumen will then feed into the styrene-\\nbutadiene-styrene PMB plant, which will have the capacity\\nto produce 30 t/hour. Some local market participants expect\\nincreased use of PMB in major road and highway projects in\\nGhana over the coming years.One domestic construction sector player said its use had\\nyet to be pursued aggressively by the country's highways au-\\nthorities. The bitumen emulsions plant will have a capacity\\nof 60 t/hr. Bitumen emulsions are already in much wider use\\nin Ghana than PMB.Page 20 of 22Copyright © 2021 Argus Media group\\nLicensed to: Shi Jia Lim, Argus Media Limited (London)\",\n",

       " 18: \"Argus BitumenIssue 21-39 | Friday 1 October 2021NewsNarrow margins pressure Iran's bitumenIranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc during\\nMarch-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costs\\nof production and weak demand from key markets.Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from\\n2.962mn t to 2.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August\\n2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result,\\nbitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during\\nthe same period.Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in\\ndomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also\\nseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of\\nVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel\\noil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of\\nfuel oil and has reduced export volumes.“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is\\nno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said\\nseveral local traders.“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past\\nmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our\\ndebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said\\nseveral producers.As a result, the number of companies trading or selling\\nbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.A gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers\\nbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy-\\ners from key markets. This was further underpinned by the\\nimpact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government\\nfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and\\nproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT\\ncosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry\\nparticipants.

This was sup-\\nported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase\\nfuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to\\nweak demand from bitumen producers.On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid\\nby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower\\nyear-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets.

       " 18: \"Argus BitumenIssue 21-39 | Friday 1 October 2021NewsNarrow margins pressure Iran's bitumenIranian bitumen production fell by an estimated 22pc during\\nMarch-August, faced by the double whammy of higher costs\\nof production and weak demand from key markets.Iran's VB feed sales volume fell by about 22pc from\\n2.962mn t to 2.314mn t between 22 March and 22 August\\n2021 compared with the same period last year. As a result,\\nbitumen production also fell by at least about 22pc during\\nthe same period.Meanwhile, bitumen sellers have seen weak demand in\\ndomestic as well as regional markets. Producers have also\\nseen an increasing squeeze on margins on the rising cost of\\nVB feed prices. This, coupled with stronger high-sulphur fuel\\noil (HSFO) economics, has resulted in higher production of\\nfuel oil and has reduced export volumes.“We reduced trading activities for bitumen as there is\\nno profit margin, and have switched to other products,” said\\nseveral local traders.“As a producer, we have faced losses over the past\\nmonths and were forced to sell our cargoes only to pay our\\ndebts from purchasing VB feed that was bought earlier,” said\\nseveral producers.As a result, the number of companies trading or selling\\nbitumen within Iran has fallen over the past few months.A gap was seen in buy-sell expectations as higher offers\\nbased on higher costs of production were rejected by buy-\\ners from key markets. This was further underpinned by the\\nimpact of Covid-19, which resulted in issues with government\\nfunds and slowed paving activities in recent months.“We purchased VB feed at 70,274 rials/kg [$285/t] and\\nproduced bitumen at $315/t fob, including storage and VAT\\ncosts, but we have sold without any profit,” said industry\\nparticipants.

This was sup-\\nported by a possible move by Iranian refineries to increase\\nfuel oil production because of higher demand, in contrast to\\nweak demand from bitumen producers.On the other hand, Iran's bitumen exports in August slid\\nby 32pc compared with a month earlier and was 48pc lower\\nyear-on-year amid low demand from Asian markets. Exports\\nfell to about 221,730t in August, down from 326,000t sold\\nin July.
